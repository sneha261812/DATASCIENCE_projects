# üìä Demographic Visualization: Age and Gender Distribution

This project presents a concise analysis and visualization of population demographics using **age (continuous variable)** and **gender (categorical variable)**. The goal is to explore basic patterns and insights that inform social, marketing, and health-related decisions.

## üîç Overview

Understanding how age and gender are distributed in a population is a fundamental step in exploratory data analysis (EDA). This project demonstrates how to:

- Visualize the spread of **ages** using histograms
- Compare **gender representation** using bar charts
- Apply basic data preprocessing techniques
- Generate clear, readable charts suitable for presentations or reports

## üìÅ Dataset

A sample dataset is used that includes demographic features for individuals:

| Column | Type     | Description                            |
|--------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| Age    | Integer  | Age of the individual                  |
| Gender | Category | Gender of the individual (e.g., Male, Female) |

> Replace with your own dataset as required.

## üìä Visualizations

1. **Age Distribution**  
   A histogram that shows the frequency distribution of ages. Useful for identifying population skewness (young, middle-aged, or elderly).

2. **Gender Distribution**  
   A bar chart summarizing the number of individuals per gender category. This reveals the balance or imbalance between genders.
